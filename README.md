##### These papers' ideas are combining the basic network with GAN.

This network structure is a reconstruction of loss of the basic segmentation network combined with GAN.

First, prediction map and label map of basic segmented network (equivalent to generator in this case) were multiplied with input to get prediction-mask and GT-mask respectively. Then, prediction was made by feeding prediction-mask and GT-mask into the discriminant network, and then loss of multi-scale was calculated.
